        NOTES

        ----Placeholders----

        #  = int or double
        "" = string
        variable = any data type
        code = your code
        name = any name
        return-type = data type of the value that gets returned; "void" can be used if no value is returned
        index = index

        ----OPERATORS----
        + - addition
        - - subtraction
        * - multiplication
        / - division
        % - modulus (finds remainder)
        > - greater than
        < - less than
        >= - greater than or equal to
        <= - less than or equal to
        == - is the same as
        != - is not the same as
        && - and
        || - or
        ! - not

        ----STRING METHODS----
        .length() - length of string
        .charAt(#) - finds the character at a certain index
        .indexOf("") - finds the index of the first occurrence of a character
        .lastIndexOf("") - finds the index of the last occurrence of a character
        .toUpperCase() - makes a string all uppercase
        .toLowerCase() - makes a string all lowercase
        .trim() - removes extra whitespace
        .replace("", "") - replaces syntax 1 with syntax 2
        .isEmpty() - if the string is empty or not
        .contains("") - if the string contains the syntax
        .equals("") - if a string is equivalent to the syntax (NOT CASE SENSITIVE)
        .equalsIgnoreCase("") - if a string is equivalent to the syntax
        .substring(#,#) - extracts out characters at indices specified in syntax (If second index is not specified it will go until the end)

        ----TERNARY OPERATOR----
        variable = (condition) ? ifTrue : ifFalse
        EX:
        String passOrFail = (score >= 60) ? "PASS" : "FAIL";

        shortcut for single if/else statements
        ifTrue - resulting value if the condition is true
        ifFalse - resulting value if the condition is false

        ----ENHANCED SWITCHES----
        switch(variable){
            case variable, variable -> code
            default -> code
        }
        EX:
        switch(day){
            case "Monday", "Tuesday" -> System.out.println("It's a weekday.");
            case "Saturday", "Sunday" -> System.out.println("It's the weekend.");
            default -> System.out.println("Not a valid day");
        }

        ----FOR LOOPS----
        for(variable;condition;step){
            code
        }
        EX:
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
            System.out.println(i + 1);

        }

        ----SLEEPING----
        Thread.sleep(milliseconds)
        EX:
        Thread.sleep(1000);

        REQUIRES: public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {}

        ----BREAK & CONTINUE----
        break; - stops the loop
        continue; - continues the loop without finishing the current iteration

        ----METHODS----
        return-type name(){
            code
        }
        EX:
        static void chaos(){
            System.out.println("Chaos, Chaos!");
        }
        chaos()

        methods are called using their name + ()
        if a method is called in a different, "static" method it is required to also be static
        methods can share the same name or parameters, but NOT both
        a method can receive a varying amount of parameters if an ellipsis is added. EX: static void add(int... numbers){}

        ----ARRAYS----
        variable[] name = {}
        EX:
        char[] chaos = {'c', 'h', 'a', 'o', 's'};

        MUST only contain one data type
        to get the value at a certain index of an array, you must do:
        name[index]
        EX:
        chaos[4];

        the above would output 's'
        string method ".length()" is compatible with arrays
        to create an empty array you must do "new variable[length]" instead of "{}" EX: String[] chaos = new String[5];
        array lengths may NOT change after the array is declared
        --2D Arrays--
        created similar to 1D arrays, except with 2 sets of brackets
        2D arrays only contain regular arrays and follow the same data type rule of 1D arrays
        variable[][] = {}
        EX:
        char[] jevil = {'j', 'e', 'v', 'i', 'l'};
        char[] spamton = {'s', 'p', 'a', 'm', 't', 'o', 'n'};

        char[][] chaos = {jevil, spamton};

        values are referenced using 2 indices EX; chaos[1][2]

        --Arrays Class--
        Arrays.sort(array) - sorts an array by alphabetical or chronological order
        Arrays.fill(array, variable) - replaces contents of an array with a specified variable

        ----OBJECTS----
        objects can take the attributes and behaviors of a class
        class name = new class()
        EX:
        Human person1 = new Human();

        inherited attributes can be referenced using object.variable
        EX:
        person1.gender

        objects can also inherit methods (behaviors) and can execute those behaviors using object.method()
        inherited methods do not need to be static to be referenced in a static method
        EX:
        person1.sit()

        inherited methods may be overwritten if it doesn't fit the child object
        it's recommended to add @Override above override methods for organization

        --ToString--
        public String toString(){
            return ""
        }
        EX:
        @Override
        public String toString(){
            return this.name + " " + this.age + " " + this.gender;
        }

        overrides the toString method to print useful information instead of a memory address

        --Constructors--
        inherited attributes can be customized when declaring the object
        EX:
        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Human person1 - new Human("Lindsey", 16, "Female");
            }

        }

        public class Human {
            String name;
            int age;
            String gender;

            Human(String name, int age, String gender){
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
                this.gender = gender;
            }

        }

        Constructors may be overloaded the same way as methods

        --Object Arrays--
        an array that holds objects of the same parent class
        class[] name = {}
        EX:
        Human[] people = {person1, person2, person3};

        ----STATIC----
        modifies a variable or method to make it belong to the class vs the object
        EX:
        static int age;

        if the above example were put in a object and the object had children, the children would NOT have a copy of this variable
        this works the same with methods
        it's recommended to access a static variable or method through the class rather than the object; Human.population vs person1.population

        ----INHERITANCE----
        a way to easily transfer attributes and methods between classes
        public class name extends parent-class{}
        EX: public class Female extends Human{

        }

        --Super--
        super(variables...)
        EX:
        super(name, age, gender);
        imports attributes from a parent class

        ----ABSTRACTION----
        a way to stop classes from having child objects
        other classes can still inherit from abstract classes
        public abstract class name {}
        EX:
        public abstract class Animal {}

        abstracted methods will be required to be overwritten in all child classes
